### Combat

    Gear/geared (Loadout): 
        Items required for combat, which are prot, pots, pearls, and enchanted swords.
    Kiting (verb): 
        Using speed potions to travel quickly across the map while in a combat situation, usually to retreat with pearled players
    Layers: 
        The number of layers of DRO in a vault spike. A "30 layer" vault spike means one has to mine through 30 pieces of DRO to 
        access the pearl chest.
    Pearl (noun): 
        Either a normal enderpearl, an exilepearl, or a prisonpearl.
    Pearling (verb): 
        The act of obtaining an exilepearl or prisonpearl via killing another player.
    Pots: 
        Potions used in combat loadouts, such as Health, Speed, Regen, Strength, etc.
    Pot bunker: 
        An IRO or DRO room made to enable people to heal, repair armor, and get new pots during fighting outside of a vault.
    Prot pinata: 
        A player wearing prot who canâ€™t fight well and just takes hit after hit before dying and losing all gear to the enemy.
    Prot/ProtIV/Prot4: 
        A full set of Protection IV enchanted diamond armor, usually with other useful enchants. This is the minimum requirement 
        to be effective in PvP. Can be seen as threatening depending on the player in question.
    Rings: 
        Obsidian trenches, usually IRO but sometimes SRO, which surround a vault spike and are used to defend against 
        a ground-based assault.
    Skybridge: 
        A bridge in the sky used to break bastions without having to break through the rest of the vault defenses so that 
        attackers can focus on pearling the defenders and mining through the spike.
    Skybunker: 
        An obsidian bunker, usually above a vault, used to defend against skybridges.
