    Factory: 
        Special setup of chest, workbench, and furnace allowing efficient production of normal or special ("lored") items through the FactoryMod plugin.
    Grief: 
        Destruction/placement of ugly blocks to deface a build or area, done to easily but effectively cause damage.
    Hiddenore: 
        A plugin that randomly generates ores as you break stone blocks. The map had no ores when it was generated, to prevent x-ray and allow 
        admins to rebalance ore distribution in the future.
    i: 
        Iron ingots, used in trade to specify prices. 20i means 20 Iron Ingots.
    Library: 
        Room(s) or building(s) that allow for player written Book & Quill books to be "borrowed". Generally done via the use of shop chests, 
        due to a lack of better options. This means that books in libraries are, effectively, bought, but can, depending on the library, also be sold back.
    Mana/Meme Mana/MM: 
        Virtual fuel for pearls, bound to a namelayer group. Can be obtained once a day by running /manaclaim,

        Virtual fuel for pearls or certain factory recipes. Used on CivRealms.
    Mod: 
        A modification to enhance the Minecraft client program, for example adding a minimap, armor status, player radar, or to run bots.

        Covering a city in SRO, as a form of griefing.
    Plugin: 
        A modification on the server to allow custom mechanics like reinforcements, factories, random respawn locations, etc. without requiring 
        changes to the Minecraft client.
    POS: 
        "Pearl on sight", used to mark a player as a criminal or threat.

        A player who is known for murdering or stealing, usually by breaking into chests.
    Reinforce (verb): 
        Using a reinforcement on a block to protect it from being broken. Used to protect builds and storage chests from getting griefed or raided.
    Reinforcement: 
        Smooth stone, iron ingot, diamond or other specific reinforcement items, which can be used to reinforce blocks.
    Shop chest: 
        Trade chest configured for ItemExchange. Left-click the chest with an empty hand to select a trade (displayed in chat), then hold the input 
        item and left-click to execute the trade.
    Snitch: Reinforced Noteblock or Jukebox that allows monitoring the 23x23x23 cube area around it by sending messages to the chat 
        of its reinforcement group when a player enters the area. Jukes also record this when noone is reading chat, as well as block 
        breaks/placements, opened chests, precise logout coordinates, killed mobs, and entering/leaving vehicles. To see the log, stand 
        in the monitored area and run the /ja command, or /jainfo next to take screenshots more easily. The log gets deleted after 2 weeks.
    Trench: 
        Used for protection of cities and vaults. Dug very deeply, often to bedrock, and bastioned to prevent bridging, so that access 
        to the contained area can be tightly controlled.
    Vault Bastion: A special lored sponge block which, when reinforced, protects a 21x21 square area from block placement and thrown 
        enderpearls from landing, unless the player is on the bastion's reinforcement group. Specifics may vary depending on a servers config.
