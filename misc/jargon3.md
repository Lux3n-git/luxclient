    POS: 
        "Pearl on sight", used to mark a player as a criminal or threat.
    PrisonPearl/PP: 
        A lored enderpearl binding its contained player to the End dimension.
    Raider: 
        A player who is known for murdering or stealing, usually by breaking into chests.
    Reinforce (verb): 
        Using a reinforcement on a block to protect it from being broken. Used to protect builds and storage chests from getting 
        griefed or raided.
    Reinforcement: 
        Smooth stone, iron ingot, diamond or other specific reinforcement items, which can be used to reinforce blocks.
    Shop chest: 
        Trade chest configured for ItemExchange. Left-click the chest with an empty hand to select a trade (displayed in chat), 
        then hold the input item and left-click to execute the trade.
    Snitch: 
        Reinforced Noteblock or Jukebox that allows monitoring the 23x23x23 cube area around it by sending messages to the chat 
        of its reinforcement group when a player enters the area. Jukes also record this when noone is reading chat, as well 
        as block breaks/placements, opened chests, precise logout coordinates, killed mobs, and entering/leaving vehicles. 
        To see the log, stand in the monitored area and run the /ja command, or /jainfo next to take screenshots more easily. 
        The log gets deleted after 2 weeks.
    Trench: 
        Used for protection of cities and vaults. Dug very deeply, often to bedrock, and bastioned to prevent bridging, 
        so that access to the contained area can be tightly controlled.
    Vault Bastion: 
        A special lored sponge block which, when reinforced, protects a 21x21 square area from block placement and thrown 
        enderpearls from landing, unless the player is on the bastion's reinforcement group. Specifics may vary depending 
        on a servers config.
