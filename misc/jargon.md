## &nJargon
    Acid blocking: 
        The act of purposefully reinforcing gold blocks to remove reinforced blocks, for example grief or derelict builds.
    Alt vault:
        A logged-out account storing valuables in its inventory. Used because items cannot be stolen while logged out, and can be 
        instantly retrieved. Disadvantages are that they cannot be accessed while pearled, and that each account needs to be 
        bought with real money.
    Alt: 
        Alternative accounts to a player's main account. Used to allow quickly logging in at a certain location possibly far 
        away from the main account ("combat alt"), or to obscure identity, for example when alt raiding or spying.
    Bastion: 
        Usually referring to Vault Bastion, sometimes City Bastion.
    Bot: 
        A script (often using MacroMod) to automatically gather resources (farms, mining, etc.). Can also refer to the alt 
        account that is currently running that script.
    Chest vault: 
        Lots of reinforced chests in a secure area, to make raiding inefficient by spreading the stored valuables across many 
        chests, requiring the raider to spend more time breaking chests than it would take to obtain the items legitimally.
    City Bastion: 
        A special lored bone block which, when reinforced, protects a 101x101 square area from reinforced block placement and 
        exiled players from entering, unless the player is on the bastion's reinforcement group. Specifics may vary depending 
        on a servers config.
    Compacted: 
        Special items created with the Compactor factory for easy storage or transport. One compacted item equals a stack (64) 
        of regular items. Compacting and decompacting are lossless, using only one crate for the former.
    Compactor: 
        Factory for compacting items.
    Component: 
        Special lored items used to create bastions or the bastion factory. Created in other factories first, drawing from all 
        parts of the tech tree.
    Crate: 
        A lored chest used to compact items in a compactor factory. Decompacting doesnâ€™t require them. Made in a carpentry 
        factory using wood and iron.
    CS: 
        A Compacted stack, or 64x64 items. Used in trade to specify big amounts of items.
