### Soil Bonus

The growth rate of a tile can be improved by placing clay blocks directly beneath. 
Placing more than 4 clay block below will not improve the rate further. Two 
exceptions exist.
    -Netherwart growth rates are not improved by clay, but by soulsand. The soulsand 
    block the warts are planted on is not counted for boost.
    -Cocoa growth rates are improved by up to 25 blocks of vine placed immediately below 
    the cocoa bean.
    
### Persistence

Crop growth is persistent, meaning crops will continue to grow when chunks are unloaded

### Sunlight

Most plants need sunlight, either directly above, or through transparent blocks such as
glass. This is not the case for netherwarts and mushrooms.

### Greenhouse

Placing a glowstone (or redstone-lamp[citation needed]) block above or adjacent to a crop 
lets the crop grow (albeit slower) in situations it normally would not. This includes crops 
which are underground or in inhospitable biomes. To grow pumpkins and melons with 
greenhouse, place the glowstone block adjacent to the free block where the fruit block 
will grow, and block all other free spots so that the fruit can only grow next to glowstone.
