### Aging

Let's start by setting up a small and large barrel.
    -A small barrel is set up using 8 stairs and 1 sign in the pattern shown. The first layer 
    is 4 stairs, the second layer is 4 stairs and then the barrel is completed by placing a 
    sign with the word "Barrel" on it. Barrel created should appear in chat if done correctly. 
    Small barrels are required to have the sign on them to work. The barrel is opened by right 
    clicking the sign and has 9 inventory slots to age brews.
    
    -A large barrel is set up using 1 fence, 16 stairs, 1 sign and 18 wood planks in the pattern 
    shown. Start by visualizing a 4 by 3 rectangle, the first layer will have upside down stairs 
    on both sides and planks to finish out the rectangle. One fence post should be placed in front
    to act as the spout. The second layer is a hollow rectangle made with planks. Note: The two 
    center blocks on this layer can either be filled up or left empty. This is a very handy spot 
    for placing a snitch. The last layer will be stairs on both sides and planks down the center. 
    Place a sign with the word "Barrel" and the message "Barrel created" should appear in chat. 
    Unlike the small barrel, you can remove the sign and thebarrel will still work. The large barrel 
    is opened by right clicking the spout and has 27 inventory slots for aging brews. CivMC's Brewery 
    config only allows you to open a large barrel by the spout but there is an option to open the barrel 
    from anywhere as well.
    
    -A barrel BLock can be used. They don't require any additional set up like the other 2 custom built
    Brewery barrels. The only downside is that they are treated as oak barrels, so you will need to 
    construct one of the other 2 types if you are aging wood specific brews.Minecraft vanilla barrels 
    support up to 27 drinks being aged at once but may be a bit buggy.

To age a brew, leave a drink in the barrel for 1 barrel year. A barrel year is 20 real life 
minutes. Brews will age even if you are offline so don't forget about them! Like distilling, only 
some brews require aging while others will be ruined by it. It is your job to experiment and figure 
out the right method to make each drink. You will get a ruined potion if a brew does not age properly.

Note: Breaking any part of the barrels will cause the contents to spill out and rendering the barrel 
useless. You will have to fix the barrel and replace the sign to recreate it.

Note: Like the distilling stand, you can place a brew in a barrel for a short while to pull up the brew's 
hidden data for determining the quality of the drink.
