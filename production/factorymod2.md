### Special factories  

#### Compactor   
    The compactor turns a stack of items and a crate (which is made in a carpentry factory) 
    into one lored compacted item, making it useful for carrying resources. The compacted item 
    stacks meaning a compacted stack can hold the square of said item stack size. For example, 
    a compacted stack of stone (which stacks to 64) fits into one inventory slot yet contains 
    4096 stone. A compacted stack of ender pearls (which stacks to 16) fits into one inventory 
    slot yet contains 256 ender pearls. The exception is items which do not stack, such as swords,
    as 8 of any unstackable item will compact into one. All compacted items must have the s
    ame NBT data, for example, you can only compact eight swords if each has same enchantment and 
    enchantment order.) Unlike compacted blocks, which cannot be placed, compacted tools armor, 
    ender pearls and so on can be used as normal. Be warned this provides no advantage and waste
    resources (For example when you use a compacted sword and uncompact it the durability of each 
    uncompacted sword equals the durability on the compacted input object effectively using durability 
    8 times faster). Selecting the 'Uncompact' recipe will return a full stack of items taking ingredient
    of 1 compacted item. Crates are not returned.

#### Cauldron factories   
    Experience cannot be gained through vanilla means and must be made in cauldron factories. 
    These create XP from large amounts of crops. The advanced cauldron factory takes and returns
    compacted materials.

#### Printing press     
    A signed book can be turned into a printing plate. The printing plate can then be used in the 
    following recipes : 'Print Book' which makes multiple book copies (without appending 'copy of');
    'Print Note' which makes a readable pamphlet from the first page of a book; 'Print Secure Note'
    which prints a note and appends the printing plates unique serial number.

#### Other    
    Additional factories with special outputs include the Bastion factory which creates lored bastion blocks. 
    A small number of factory recipes are in fact less efficient than vanilla. Smelt lapis into lapis blocks 
    in ore smelter gives slightly less output than using fortune III on lapis ore (avg 13.5 vs 14.3).
