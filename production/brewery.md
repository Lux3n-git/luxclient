## Brewery

Brewery is a plugin that allows players to make their own liquor. 
Recipes typically vary across each server and may be kept secret by the
server's administrators, requiring experimentation by players to discover.

### Set Up

Before you start brewing, you will need some supplies to set up your brewing 
location. You will need:
    -Wood for barrels. You will need wood stairs for small barrels and wood 
    stairs/planks/fences for large barrels.
        -Note: For large brewing locations, you should make 8 barrels using each 
        of the 8 types of wood. (Acacia, Spruce, Dark Oak, Oak, Jungle, Birch, Crimson 
        & Warped)
    -Cauldrons for fermenting. This parameter is also called "time cooked".
    -A source of fire. Since fire spread is turned off, you can light any block 
    on fire indefinitely with flint & steel. Lava will also work.
    -A source of water. You will want to make an infinity pool nearby.
    -Brewing stands for distilling. These do not require blaze powder when distilling.
    -Barrels for aging. See the aging section below for how to set up custom barrels.
    -Glass bottles for collecting your completed brew.
    -A clock to keep track of how long a brew has been fermenting. Right click a 
    cauldron with a clock to see how many minutes the cauldron has been brewing.
    -Lots of different ingredients. A detailed list will be included in this guide 
    for the items that are accepted into the cauldron.
    -Chests to store your brews in and to keep your ingredients safe.
