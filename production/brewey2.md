### Fermenting

Let's start by setting up a cauldron to ferment brews in.
    -Place the cauldron in a convenient spot and make sure the block 
    underneath it is empty.
    -Place your source of fire underneath the cauldron. Remember, this 
    can either be lava or a flame lit with flint & steel.
    -Place water from a water bucket into your cauldron. That's it! You're
    all done with setting up your fermentation cauldron.

In order to ferment ingredients into a brew, right click the cauldron with the 
ingredient in your hand. Although it's disabled, it is best to remove any items 
in your offhand so you don't accidentally switch hands and add extra ingredients. 
Now that you have an ingredient or multiple ingredients in the cauldron, right click 
that cauldron with a clock. You will be able to track how long the brew has been 
fermenting. After you are satisfied with the duration of fermentation, use a bottle 
to remove the brew from your cauldron! 

### Distilling

Let's start by setting up a distillery brewing stand.
    -Place the brewing stand in your desired location and place exactly one glowstone 
    dust in the top of the brewing stand. Distilling will not use up that one piece of 
    glowstone dust, however, placing more than one glowstone dust will needlessly cause 
    the glowstone to be used up until one is left. Additionally, blaze powder is not 
    needed to distill drinks.
    -Place your fermented brews into the brewing stand. After waiting for a short while, 
    you will see the drink gain lore for the amount of times it was distilled. MOST of the 
    time if you made an indefinable distillate, that means the recipe you used wasn't 
    accurate or that the drink didn't need to be distilled.

Note: For brews that require distilling, the quality of the drink is affected by how many 
times the drink is distilled. Do some experimenting to find out the required number of 
distillations for the drink! Information about the drink can be obtained by leaving it 
in the distillation stand.
