### Drinking Effects

While drinking, you can receive a multitude of side effects as a result of getting drunk. 
Each player has an alcohol limit of 100/100 and each drink will add to that limit until you
exceed 100. Once you go over 100, you will pass out and get kicked from the server. In 
addition to the effects a brew may give you, the following effects may occur depending on
your alcohol limit:
    -&lSlurred Speech: &r&fAs you get more drunk, the Brewery Mod will detect certain 
    combinations of letters or phrases and jumble them up in chat. A single word like 
    "hello" could turn into a full sentence of random slurred speech. Additionally, text on 
    signs will also appear slurred after you finish typing on them.
    -&lStumbled Walk: &r&fYou may find yourself moving in one direction on your own and have 
    little control over moving in that direction. This becomes increasingly bad as you near 
    the 100 alcohol limit.
    -&lPassing Out: &r&fWhen you exceed your 100 alcohol limit (There isn't currently a way 
    to check your current alcohol amount so be careful!), you will get kicked from the server. 
    When trying to log back in, it may tell you that you're too drunk to log in! Just keep 
    trying and eventually you'll be able to rejoin. Be careful though because you will be combat 
    tagged on drunk log out and can be easily killed.
    -&lNausea: &r&fAs you near the 100 alcohol limit, you may get increasingly bad spells of nausea 
    that can last a few seconds or a few minutes. Stop being such a drunkard!
        Note: You can turn lessen or turn off nausea effects in your Minecraft accessibility settings.
    -&lVomiting: &r&fAfter you reach a certain alcohol limit, you may start spewing soul sand everywhere. 
    This is just a visual effect and you can't pick the soul sand up. The frequency of this happening 
    increases if you drink lower quality drinks or ruined potions.
    -&lPoison: &r&fAside from a few brews having poison as an effect in the config, if you drink 
    imperfect brews (Especially ruined potions) you have a chance of poisoning yourself.
    -&lHangover: &r&fIf you log out while you are drunk, and log back in later that day, you will 
    log in with weakness, hunger or slowness effects due to a hang over. This is more likely to be 
    severe if you got drunk off of lower quality or ruined brews.
