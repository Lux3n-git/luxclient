## &nBotting

A variety of frameworks such as AdvancedMacros can be used to automate tasks. 
In particular bots are used extensively in the creation of XP. All bots must 
abide to server botting rules, which include the prohibition of reading 
environmental data. 

### Farming Methods

Before building Redstone-powered farms, ensure they do not exceed redstone 
chunk limits (water streams can often be used as a replacement).

### Obsidian

Due to the SimpleAdminHacks plugin, Obsidian can be generated using String 
and Lava. An ideal place to set up such an Obsidian generator is between 
several cave spider spawners. Hooking those up to an automatic system killing
the spiders and moving the String to a bot player allows generating large amounts 
of obsidian automatically.

### Portal Farms

Although there is no Nether dimension, Nether portals still spawn Pigmen. This 
can be used to make AFK gold farms by surrounding the player with lots of portals 
and putting open trapdoors on their bottom edges, allowing the Pigmen to walk and 
fall down into a water collection and killing system. Note that mob AI is disabled 
for entities more than 10 blocks away from the player, so only portals within that 
range will be effective.
