## &nArthropod egg

Killing a mob with a weapon that has the "Bane of the Arthropods" enchantment
has a chance to drop a spawn egg item for the slain mob type. Each level of 
"Bane of the Arthropods" will increase the drop rate by 3%. The drop rate will 
also be increased by 2% for every "Looting" enchantment level. A monster that 
drops a spawn egg will not drop any other loot.
