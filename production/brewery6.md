### Sobering Up

There are a few ways that you can sober up to help reduce your alcohol limit.
    -Over time, you will slowly get less drunk and the effects of drinking will become 
    shorter and more spread out
    -You can eat certain foods to reduce your alcohol limit. (Note: It is uncertain if 
    this works properly on CivMC)
        -Drinking a milk bucket will remove all potion effects and reduce your alcohol 
        limit by 3 points each
            -Note: For cases of nausea, milk is rather ineffective since the nausea will 
            continually reoccur for a little while.
        -Eating bread will reduce your alcohol limit by 3 points each
        -Eating a potato will reduce your alcohol limit by 4 points each
        -Eating a baked potato will reduce your alcohol limit by 6 points each
    -Some drinks can now lower your alcohol limit too! Teas, food based drinks and other 
    beverages can decrease your alcohol limit between -1 to -10 depending on the drink.

### Brew Unlabeling

Unlabeling a brew will remove a few pieces of brew drink data so you can protect your recipes 
from being easily discovered. Unlabeling a brew will remove cauldron cook time, years aged and 
number of time distilled. (Will still display it was aged or distilled though). There are two
different ways to unlabel a brew:
    -While you have a brew highlighted in your hot bar, type the command "/brew unlabel" and it 
    will unlabel the brew.
    -You can craft a custom item called the "Brew Sealing Table". It is crafted by using 2 glass 
    bottles in a row and four wood planks underneath the bottles in a square. The Brew Sealing 
    Table allows you to automatically use the /brew unlabel command for every brew you stick in it. 
    Place a brew into the table, wait a few seconds for a clunk sound and it will auto run the 
    command every time you place a brew in it.

Note: There is a weird visual glitch if you shift click a brew from your hot bar into the menu, it
will look like it duplicates your brew. It does not.
