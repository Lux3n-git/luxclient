## OldEnchanting

### Acquiring Experience
Experience is not dropped by any vanilla means (mobs, ores, smelting). Instead it 
must be made using a Cauldron factory. Each has four recipes taking various farmable 
items as input. Upgraded cauldron factories provide more efficient conversions.
    -The only way to get XP is by crafting bottle o' enchanting by placing an emerald 
    in a crafting grid.
    -Enchanting does not consume any Lapis Lazuli and works in a similar manner than
    the pre 1.8 enchanting system, taking the full amount of experience.
    -One bottle o' enchanting will always give 10 XP points. This means that a level 
    30 enchant will require 140 bottles.
    -Items can be infinitely repaired and the repair cost is capped at level 35. 
    (Items will be repairable forever but will be expensive to repair in the long run, 
    capping out at 35 levels with no reset.)
    -It is not possible to enchant books (although Enchanted books can be found in
    naturally generated chests (e.g: dungeons and abandoned mines)
    -The Mending and Frost Walkers enchantments are disabled.

### Experience Storage
Experience exists in four forms: in a player's experience bar, as experience bottles,
as Emeralds, and as Emerald blocks. All these can be converted into each other: crafting 
9 experience bottles created 1 Emerald, 9 Emeralds make an Emerald block, and vice versa. 
By clicking on an enchanting table while holding bottles you can turn all of your levels 
into experience bottles. One bottle o' enchanting will give exactly 10 XP points. By right 
clicking an enchantment table or anvil while holding emeralds, the emerald XP is transferred 
directly to your player.
