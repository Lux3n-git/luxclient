## &nHiddenOre

Ores have a random chance of spawning adjacent to (or replacing) blocks which a player 
mines (HiddenOre). If the block is stone or terracotta the ore will be an overworld ore.
If the block is Netherrack the ore will be a Nether ore. The chance of an ore block 
spawning is based upon: number of faces revealed by breaking a block + block itself. 
Ore spawn chances are dependent on y-level, with probabilities roughly corresponding 
to vanilla.

### General mining strategies
Ore spawning decreases after many blocks in a chunk have been mined.
    -Mining blocks which cannot generate ores (such as gravel) will thus decrease
    ore spawn chances. This also applies to placing blocks such as torches.
    -Attempts to abuse HiddenOre, such as mining and replacing the same block 
    multiple times will likely also decrease ore spawn chances.

### Emeralds
Emerald Ore is not spawned via HiddenOre. It can be found only in the Extreme Hills 
+ biome in bunches of 1 to 10 ore blocks, making it considerably rare (whereas in 
+ vanilla they only spawn as single blocks and also in "normal" Extreme Hills).

### Diamond mining
Diamonds spawn at the vanilla height, below layer Y=17. Unlike all other ores, diamonds 
will spawn in HiddenOre veins. Finding a diamond thus indicates a cluster of nearby diamonds. 
Veins are randomly generated using a Perlin noise. The vein itself is a disc rotated in 
3d space. The diamond density in a vein is higher near the center. A message will be 
displayed every time a diamond ore spawns.

### Strategies
Mining a long tunnel is a good way to find veins. If a player already possess resources, 
one of fastest ways to mine is using a haste II beacon and efficiency V silk touch 
pickaxes. Cheaper diamond mining methods include wjkroeker's method, one of the most 
space efficient. If a player has a minimap mod, it can be useful to waypoint or 
otherwise mark diamonds to discern the shape and center of the vein.

### Fossils
Mining stone blocks has a random chance to drop a fossil. Fossils are a lored 
Prismarine Shard. They can be cracked by using the "Ore Smelter" factory for random,
albeit unlikely, treasure.
