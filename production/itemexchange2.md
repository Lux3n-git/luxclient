### 2) Second way to create exchange rules:

If you don't have access to the items you're buying/ selling there are other commands you can use.

&l/iec input [item] [quantity]
For example: /iec input diamond 5

&l/iec output [item] [quantity]
For example: /iec output sapling 10

Note: The name of the item has to be the Minecraft data name. For example, dark_oak_sapling.

### Editing exchange rules

While holding an exchange, use the following command to change the quantity it trades:

&l/ies amount [number]
For example: /ies amount 5. This will change the exchange to trade 5 of whatever item
