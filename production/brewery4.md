### Brew Drink Data
A brew's data can be pulled up by placing the drink in a distillation stand or an aging 
barrel. This can only be done if you have a named drink and not one of the base drinks, 
indefinite brews or ruined potions.
Brewery Drink Data Example: All parameters are green and the drink has 5 stars indicating 
it is perfect. It also shows the alcohol amount and lore.

The following 6 values could show up on the brew:
    -Quality: The number of stars on a drink indicates its quality with 5 stars being a perfect 
    brew. Drinking lesser quality drinks will make you more likely to puke when very drunk.
    -Ingredients: How accurate your ingredients in the brew are to the perfect recipe
    -Minutes Fermented: How accurate the fermentation time is to the perfect recipe
    -Distillation Runs: How many times the drink was distilled compared to the perfect recipe
    -Years Aged: How long the brew was aged compared to the perfect recipe
    -Wood Type: If the correct wood type is being used or not (This will only show up for brews 
    that require a specific wood type)

Note: Each of the above lore values will have a color associated with them; Green, Yellow, Orange 
or Red. If the value is perfect, it will show up green. Depending on the difficulty of the brew, 
the further you are away from the perfect amount, the drink data values will show up yellow, orange
and then red.

In addition to the above values, a brew may also contain any of the following:
    -Lore: A drink might have a small line of lore text in blue underneath the perfect drink's name. 
    This will show up on the drink at all times.
    -Title Message: After drinking a brew, you may see a message appear in the center of your screen 
    for a few seconds before disappearing. This data will not show up on the bottle before drinking.
    -Chat Message: After drinking a brew, you may see a message appear in your chat. This data will 
    not show up on the bottle before drinking.
    -Alcohol Amount: When you stick a drink in a distilling stand, it may show the drink's alcohol 
    amount in ml. This number is the alcohol's potency out of 100.
