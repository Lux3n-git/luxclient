## &nTradePlus

TradePlus is a GUI based trading plugin used for players to trade items without
dropping items and a faster way to exchange items.

Type &l/trade &r&fwithin 5 blocks of another player to open a trade GUI. 

In the GUI there will be 2 sections: 
  -The Left side is for your items.
  -The Right side is for the person's items that you're trading with. 
  
Whenever your trading partner puts an item in the trade, it will appear on
his side of the menu (right side). To put your items in the trade, drag the 
items into your side in the GUI (left side).

Both you and your trading partner must accept the trade in order for the 
trade to fully complete. To accept the trade, click the green box on the top 
left of the menu. 

When both players click accept, there is a 10 second timer until the trade is 
complete. Within that time, either player can cancel the trade.
