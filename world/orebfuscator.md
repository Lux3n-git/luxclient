## Orebfuscator   

Orebfuscator (from ore obfuscator) prevents using X-ray to see blocks
a normal player cannot. First, it hides useful blocks as stone when 
outside an eight block proximity. Second, it causes random blocks 
to render underground.

Hidden blocks that render as stone when viewed from a distance include:
   -chest, ender_chest, trapped_chest and clay, in addition to all 
   types of ores and shulker boxes.

Random blocks that render underground in order to obfuscate include:
   -cave_air, cobblestone, mossy_cobblestone, obsidian, stone, TNT, 
   clay and all types of ores

Due to lag, even nearby blocks can sometimes appear as obfuscated. 
However, Orebfuscator only modifies what the client sees and thus the 
obfuscated blocks are not actually changed.

### Usage

Because of the range of the Orebfuscator, it is advisable to dropchest 
at least 8 blocks below the ground.
