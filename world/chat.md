Players who donate $10 or more to the CivClassic Patreon have ability to change the color their 
  name displays in chat and tab menu using the command &l&l/namecolor. For $25 the color can be 
  set as rainbow. [2]. Note not to confuse the grey colored names with the greyed out spectator
  names, which unlike namecolor can only be used by superfriends or admins. Note that as of 
  August 2020, the namecolor feature is currently broken.
