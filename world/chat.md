Chat is range restricted to be local. Messages are only seen within a 1000 block radius from the sending 
player (plus an additional block in range for each each block above y=100). This range restriction can be bypassed 
by using chat groups or direct messages.

Namelayer allows the creation of chat groups. Chat groups are managed with Namelayer which includes functionality 
for inviting and removing players from groups.

### Namecolors  

Players who donate $10 or more to the CivClassic Patreon have ability to change the color their name displays in chat and tab menu using the command /namecolor. For $25 the color can be set as rainbow. [2]. Note not to confuse the grey colored names with the greyed out spectator names, which unlike namecolor can only be used by superfriends or admins. Note that as of August 2020, the namecolor feature is currently broken.
