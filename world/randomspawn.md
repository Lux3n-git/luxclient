## &nRandomSpawn

New players will spawn in a random city spawn point that has a player within 700 blocks.
If no city spawn point has a player within 700 blocks, new players will spawn in the same 
manner as existing players. Existing players (who have not set their spawn-point with a bed) 
will respawn in a random location in within a 7000 block radius circle around 0,0. 
Newly spawned Alts are counted as existing players.

Players will always spawn on the highest block available. Certain blocks, such as water, 
obsidian, and carpet, are blacklisted and players will not spawn on them.

### Usage

It can be useful to die multiple times in order to randomspawn closer to a destination. 
There is no penalty to randomspawning.
