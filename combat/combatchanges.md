    -Dual wielding is enabled.
    -Clicking at rate higher than 8.5 (?) CPS will decrease the overall damages dealt.
    -Ender Pearls have a cooldown of 15 seconds (vs. 1s in vanilla).
    -Ender Crystals do not inflict damage on the player but will still destroy surrounding blocks.
    -Snowballs and eggs do no inflict damage nor knock players back but will slightly damage armor.

    -Enchanted golden apples turn to normal golden apples when eat attempted.
    -Increases damage reduction granted by the Protection enchantment
    -Nerfs the strength potion back to pre-1.5 mechanics
    -Tripled added damage from strength potion levels
    -30% chance projectile causes slow debuff for 100 ticks
