## &nCombatTag

CombatTag is a server plugin which is used to balance PvP (Player vs Player combat).

When you are "combat tagged" you are unable to log out of the server safely by using 
&l/logout&r&f. Instead, you are stuck in the server for a short period of time, and if you 
simply disconnect from the server you will leave behind a "combat logger". Your body 
is left behind for 30 seconds, and you can still be killed and pearled after you disconnect.

When you first join the server you are combat tagged for 10 seconds, When somebody hits you, 
you are combat tagged for 30 seconds. This is to prevent you getting into a PvP fight and 
deciding to just logout to avoid being killed.

Make sure to always find a safe spot and /logout to leave the server safely. You will 
have to stand still for 10 seconds in order to log out safely, but this will avoid leaving 
your body behind for 30 seconds.
