Fuel pearls with activity

Captors must periodically fuel pearls. The fuel for pearls is essence. Players 
can claim essence (often referred as mana) daily.
    -Essence is automatically claimed after playing for 30 minutes. Logging out 
        does not reset the timer.
    -Players have to wait 18 hours before being able to claim again. After that, 
        they have a 24 hours window to claim again.
    -The amount of essence that is received is equal to the number of times the 
        player has claimed essence during the last 8 days. This amount is capped 
        at 8. The streak can be checked using the /streak command.
    -Voting for the server on a server ranking website will reward 1 essence per 
        vote, per day. The 3 affected websites are minecraft-mp.com, 
        minecraftservers.org and minecraft-server-list.com. Players only get essence 
        for voting every 20 hours. The voting links can be checked using the /vote 
        command. The player must be online when voting to receive essence.
    -Alts share the same pool of mana. It is not possible to claim essence several 
    time on the same day but on different alts.

Placing the pearl in a chest with the required amount of mana will allow the player 
to continue to be bound to the pearl. Not remembering will have the pearl decay,
by 8 health per hour.
