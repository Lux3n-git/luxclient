## &nExilePearl 

Killing a player while having an Ender Pearl in your hotbar will imprison the killed player and bind them to the item. 
The pearled player cannot be within 1000 blocks of their pearl if the pearl is inside a container (such as a chest). 
A player can not be pearled twice. Trying to pearl an exiled player will show the coordinates of their pearl.
Exiled players cannot: 
    -Light fires
    -Use potions
    -Throw pearls
    -Engage in PvP with another player
    -Place TNT
    -Enter bastion fields. An exiled players who enters a bastion field will be teleported 
        outside of it unless the bastion's namelayer group has BASTION_ALLOW_EXILED enabled
    -Damage bastions
    -Damage reinforced blocks
    -Place snitches

However there are ways around some restrictions. For example, although exiled players cannot 
damage other players with weapons, they may still damage them with fireworks, falling anvils and more.

### Prison Pearl

Players whose pearl has been upgraded to a prison pearl are sent to the end and therefore are not able to be sent back 
into the overworld. They will be permanently in the end. There are several end portals throughout the map that allow 
people to visit the end, however, and non-pearled players can return to the overworld.

It costs 64 mana to upgrade to a prison pearl.

### Pearl fueling & decay

    -In order to fuel an Exile Pearl or Prison pearl, craft the pearl in your inventory or 
        crafting table with the desired amount of Player Essence. Before confirming, check to 
        see the resulting percentage the pearl will be filled to.
    -Exile Pearls decay at a rate of 16 mana a week. (incorrectly labeled as costing 8 mana a week)
    -Prison Pearls decay at a rate of 64 mana a week.
