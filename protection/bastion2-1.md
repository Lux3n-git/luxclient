Bastions are created with FactoryMod using a bastion factory. 
To build one, it costs 32 of each of the 6 lored bastion components, 
each coming from a separate factory: 















This means that, not including the 6 factories above, the total cost of a 
bastion factory is roughly 96 diamonds, 192 emeralds, 174 iron blocks, 
57 gold blocks, 121 redstone blocks, 1024 ice, 1024 glass, 1024 charcoal, 
512 lapis blocks, 512 obsidian, 512 chests, 512 grass blocks, 192 gunpowder, 
96 slimeballs, 32 eyes of ender, and a lot of lava. Due to this steep price,
most players produce bastions collaboratively or purchase them from others 
with the means.
