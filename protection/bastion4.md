### Advanced Bastion Mechanics

### Overlapping Fields

While it is efficient to spread bastions out, defensive structures make use of overlapping bastion
fields to ensure breaking a single bastion won't grant the breaker access to a full 21x21 area. 
In open spaces, blocks placed in the overlap would be a liability (since both bastions would take 
full damage) but vaults use walls and other physical barriers to prevent attackers from doing so. 
Immense subdivision and traps make ground assaults against such a structure difficult.

One other form of field overlap involves the vertical dimension. You can protect an area in the sky 
(typically at sky limit, but not always) by forcing attackers to break one bastion at a time. This 
is achieved by separating bastion layers by 8 blocks (to prevent mining) and moving each successive 
layer one block diagonally away from the center. Unless they can find a way to place bastions closer 
to the center (either on the outside of your structure or on top of it) they can only break a single 
bastion layer at a time.

### Block glitching

Vault bastions remove block placements, yet for a tick the block appears as normal. Server rules allow 
using block glitching to pillar out from holes. Block glitching more than a few blocks high is possible 
although timings make it difficult.

### Exile glitching

Exile players are teleported outside of bastion fields. With a correct setup this can allow teleportation 
over large distances. This is against server rules.

### Blocking

    -Vault bastions will block Block placements, Pearls, Elytra, Piston extensions causing block to enter 
       bastion field, liquids from flowing into field (including through dispenser), exiled players from entering.
    -Vault bastions will not block entities (including falling entities), dragon eggs teleporting into field, 
       bonemeal usage inside field.
