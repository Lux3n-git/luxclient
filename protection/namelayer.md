## &nNameLayer
A Citadel reinforcement group manager. Allows the creation of groups in Minecraft. From 
buildings to chat messages, one can selectivity restrict or expand which players have access.

The extensive Namelayer commands can be entirely avoided:

    /nl [group] - Open Namelayer GUI.

The first screen of the Namelayer GUI shows rows of chestplates each corresponding to a 
Namelayer group, each chestplate type corresponding to a permission level (Leather =
Member, Gold = Mod, Iron = Admin, Diamond = Owner. The enchanted chestplate shows the 
default group which is the group reinforcements will be on after typing only /ctf). 
For example the admin owner permission level gives the ability to delete the group 
while the member does not by default.

Even though an account can be Owner of any number of NameLayer groups, an account can 
only be Primary Owner of up to 15 groups; after that, group creations and Primary Owner 
transfers to that account are denied, until groups are either transferred to another 
account or deleted. One can get around this limit by owning multiple accounts and adding 
the actively used accounts as Owner (instead of Primary Owner, which is one of the alt accounts).

### Updating username

Usernames are permanent. Once an account has logged in, it won't be possible to change the 
username. Changing the username using the official Minecraft website will not change it on CivMC.

Should a player log in with an already used username, its displayed name will have "1" added at the end.
