## &nVault

A vault is a fortified structure used to store pearled players and/or other valuables. 
Pearls are typically held inside a chest, encased by a mound of obsidian at the center 
called a pyramid. These pyramids are most commonly found in large holes in the ground 
that have been dug out from surface level all the way to bedrock level. Other fortifications 
are often built to protect the pyramid, such as concentric rings of bastions and obsidian 
walls. Bunkers or towers are often constructed above the main part of the vault to store 
materials, factories, and potions for vault defense and to supply fighters.

A large ringed vault is often referred to as a "megavault", "gigavault" or even 
"hypervault" depending on the size. Ringed vaults generally take many hours to break, 
sieges against the largest vaults possibly even taking days. Vaults vary in size from 
the 4 ring former USA North vault to the largest vault on CivClassic, Mir's Sanctaphrax, 
which contains over 30 rings.
